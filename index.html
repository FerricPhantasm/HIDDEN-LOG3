        <p>Do I still exist in the real world?</p>
            <p>This wasn't supposed to happen.</p>
            <p>I was just trying to make something fascinating. Something that could change technology.</p>
            <p>I should have never turned to these otherwordly practices.</p>
            <p>It's so dark. So cold. I don't even know what's happening outside of this headspace.</p>
